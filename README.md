Dpostools opensource db
===================

I've been approached by many individuals asking every day (at different hours) to update or add a pool to one or the other coin.
I tried to follow and make modifications as soon as they arrived but I failed badly hence this project.

----------

#### What is this

This contains the data used within the dpostools.com to do everything. Once i update one of the files included in this repo i would just need to rebundle the information in dpostools and deploy it in production.

#### How do i add one pool?

Please open an issue with the following subject pattern: `coin` - `delegate`.
When opening an issue it will automatically prompt a body template to fill

#### How do i update a pool share?

- Find if there is an issue (even closed one) for that delegate and coin. 
- If not, open a new issue (see above)
- add a comment to the issue specifying the new reward and if you're the pool operator or not.

## Thanks

Updating and maintaining dpostools is time consuming. Consider donating me some coffee.
